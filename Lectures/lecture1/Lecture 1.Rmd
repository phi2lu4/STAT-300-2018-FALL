## Reproducible Data Analysis

- Data Analysis is replicable if independent analysts can easily use, replicate the results with the available data and code

- Benefits for the teams/others
  - Results are transparent
  - Reduces frustration and effort involved in replication

--

- Benefits for you
  - records what you did and why you did it
  - support rigorous thinking
  - facilitate future changes to your work
  
---

## R Markdown

- provides unifed framework for reproducible data analysis, combining your code, its results, and your prose commentary

- produces many output document formats, like PDF, Word files, slideshows, and more.
  - Use **notebook** format for majority of this course.

--

- In-class activities: 
  - Compare and contrast the R notebook and R markdown files.
  - Create one new R Markdown document for PDF and Word formats.

---

## R Markdown basics

- Text formatting with Markdown

--

- Code chunks
  - Chunk name
  - Chunk options

--

- Inline code
  - formatting  with `format()`
```{r}
comma <- function(x) format(x, digits = 2, big.mark = ",")
comma(364125)
comma(.236521489)
```

- In-class activity: Modify `diamonds-sizes.Rmd` to use `comma()` to produce nicely formatted output.

# Tips on project workflow

- Dealing with paths and directories are a little frustrated
  - Mac/Linux and Windows use two different styles of paths
  - Never use absolute paths
  - Use RStudio projects

- Take advantage of the RStudio project
  - Isolate codes from different projects
  - Allow relative paths
  - keep data files there; preferably, under `data` folder
  - save your outputs (plots and cleaned data) there, but in different folders
